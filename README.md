# Analysis-of-Public-Charging-Infrastructure-in-Germany

Electric mobility is critical to ensuring a sustainable future all over the world. Electric vehicles are becoming increasingly popular, and they offer an appealing 
alternative to internal combustion engines. However, good infrastructure for charging electric vehicles is required to ensure the success of electric mobility.

In this study, we look at charging stations all over Germany. The data is available on the following webpage and includes all public charging points in Germany
(as reported to the Bundesnetzagentur!). It is possible that charging locations not included in this data set can be found in other sources.

The research is divided into four sections:
1. EV charging station data set in Germany
2. Translation of data frames
3. Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis
4. Providing answers and drawing conclusions
